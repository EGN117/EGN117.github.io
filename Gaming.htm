Gaming has been a big part of my life and it has taught me many things, I learnt how to speak English trough video games. When I lived in Mexico I played a lot of online multiplayer on my Xbox 360 and in order for me to communicate with my teammates I had to speak English, because most of the time I was matched with players from the US. Since I spent a lot of the time playing video games which meant I spent a lot of the time speaking English which inevitable made my English better.
