    <p>I've been teaching myself the 3 core languages of the web which are HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
     <br>   
    <p>
    The first language I learnt was HTML, at the beginning I found difficult learning all the different syntaxes. I thought I would never be able to remember them all, however when you begin applying your knowledge practically things become easier to remember. Trial and error was also a key concept that allowed me to overcome any obstacle that I may have found not only that but, it also serves as a reminder on how to solve problem if you encounter it again in the future.
